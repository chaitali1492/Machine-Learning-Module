# E-commerce Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis

## Abstract
In this project, we analyze and segment the customers of an e-commerce company using the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** approach. This enables the company to optimize retention and acquisition strategies.

## Market Outlook
E-commerce businesses that have become success stories succeeded by targeting the right customers. Effective customer segmentation can be performed across these categories:
- **Geographic**: Based on country, state, and city.
- **Demographic**: Based on gender, age, income, education level, etc.
- **Psychographic**: Based on lifestyle, age, religious beliefs, and other preferences.
- **Behavioral**: Based on personality traits, attitudes, interests, and purchase patterns.

## Problem Overview
The company has provided data related to e-commerce transactions, which includes:
- Date-time of sale.
- Customer shipping location.
- Price of a single unit.
- Transactions from **2016 to 2017**.

The organization seeks meaningful insights from this two-year data to understand customer behavior and improve marketing strategies.

## Objective
The goal is to build an **unsupervised learning model** to:
1. Analyze customers using the RFM approach.
2. Segment customers based on:
   - **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase.
   - **Frequency**: How often a customer makes purchases.
   - **Monetary Value**: How much money a customer spends.
3. Provide actionable insights for cost-efficient and targeted marketing strategies.

## Key Features
- **Customer Segmentation**: Grouping customers based on their purchase behavior.
- **Insight Generation**: Identifying key patterns in customer data.
- **Strategy Development**: Tailored marketing strategies for retention and acquisition.

## Dataset Details
The dataset contains:
- **Transaction Date**: Date and time of the purchase.
- **Customer Location**: Shipping details, including country, state, and city.
- **Price**: Unit price of the product.

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning and structuring the data for analysis.
   - Handling missing or inconsistent values.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Calculating RFM metrics for each customer.

3. **Unsupervised Learning**:
   - Applying clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means) to segment customers.

4. **Insights**:
   - Identify customer groups based on purchase behavior.
   - Suggest data-driven marketing strategies.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn` for clustering.

## Results
The segmentation will help the company:
- Focus marketing efforts on high-value customers.
- Develop strategies for retaining loyal customers.
- Design campaigns to re-engage inactive customers.

## Conclusion
By leveraging customer segmentation through RFM analysis, the company can implement cost-effective and efficient marketing strategies tailored to specific customer segments.
